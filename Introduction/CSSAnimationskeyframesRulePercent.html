    <title>CSS Animations - The @keyframes Rule</title>
    <style>
        div {
            width: 100px;
            height: 100px;
            background-color: red;
            animation-name: example;
            animation-duration: 4s;
        }

        @keyframes example {
            0% {background-color:red;}
            25% {background-color:yellow;}
            50% {background-color:blue;}
            100% {background-color:green;}
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>

    <p><b>Note:</b> The animation-duration property defines how long an animation should take to complete. 
        If the animation-duration property is not specified, no animation will occur, because the default value is 0s 
        (0 seconds).
    </p>

    <p>
        In the example above we have specified when the style will change by using the keywords "from" and "to" 
        (which represents 0% (start) and 100% (complete)).
    </p>

    <p>
        It is also possible to use percent. By using percent, you can add as many style changes as you like.
    </p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> This example does not work in Internet Explorer 9 and earlier versions.</p>
