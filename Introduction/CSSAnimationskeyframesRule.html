    <h2>CSS Animations</h2>

    <p>An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.</p>

    <p>You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times as you want.</p>

    <p>To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.</p>

    <p>Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.</p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> This example does not work in Internet Explorer 9 and earlier versions.</p>

    <div></div>

    <p><b>Note:</b> When an animation is finished, it changes back to its original style.</p>
